    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Nacho.
\n\nI love developing for mobile.
\n\nI like doing it for Android, but Kotlin Multiplatform will be the future as well.
\nCheck my repositories in GitHub :) https://github.com/IgnacioGarcia198
\nFun fact is that I can walk handstanding. Also I make a Pokemon Quiz app but couldn\'t make it public
\nin Play Store because of the copyright ^^U
\n\nI also like running. The last year in Japan I almost had no time to run so I need training now.
\nAnd sometimes I do callisthenics as well.
\nI like writing from time to time as well, you could check this blog: http://comolasondassonoras.blogspot.com :)
\nMy wife is Japanese and very strict, yes sir!.
\n少しでも私も日本語が出来ます。もしもし？きつねさんではないでしょうか。\n\n</string>
